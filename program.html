                    The school starts on Monday, September 29th at 8:30 and finishes on Saturday, October 4th at 12:00. The optional Conversation on Science and Music event will subsequently take place on Saturday, October 4th from 16:00 - 18:45.

                    The school will combine lectures, talks, and discussion sessions to allow for in-depth exchanges with both the invited speakers and the other participants. A number of arrangements will be put in place to stimulate intellectual exchange among participants and speakers. In particular, participants will be asked to engage with introducing the speakers and moderating the discussions. Moreover, thematic groups involving participants and speakers will be established on the first day and will report their conclusions at the end of the school. Guidelines will be provided after acceptance.
                </p>

                    Participants are required to participate for the whole duration of the school, to reciprocate a similar commitment by the speakers. There will be time to explore Venice in the evenings and during a free afternoon halfway through the school. A detailed program will be published closer to the start of the conference.
