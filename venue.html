					The School will take place in the historical Portego Room of Palazzo Cavalli-Franchetti, 
					one of the two landmark buildings of the Istituto Veneto di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti. Palazzo 
					Franchetti is located near the Ponte dell’Accademia bridge on the opposite side of the Canal 
					Grande from the Accademia Galleries and Accademia vaporetto (water bus) station. Directions to 
					Accademia or Ponte dell'Accademia are scattered throughout the city. If you get lost, ask for 
					Accademia, but then remember to cross the bridge for Palazzo Franchetti. The Room of the School 
					is located on the ground floor with full accessibility.

					<h3 class="editable">Arriving by train</h3>
					<p>
						To minimise the School’s environmental impact we strongly recommend that you travel to Venice by 
						train whenever feasible. Venice’s main station—Venezia Santa Lucia—is part of Italy’s excellent high 
						speed train network and offers direct trains to many European cities (including Geneva, Munich, Vienna, 
						and Zurich). A direct train brings you in 2.5h to Milan from where many other destinations in France, 
						Germany, Switzerland and beyond can be reached. There are two train companies servicing Venice: Italo 
						and Trenitalia. For schedules and more details, see the 
						<a href="https://www.trenitalia.com/en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trenitalia</a> 
						and <a href="https://www.italotreno.com/en/destinations-timetable" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Italo</a> websites.
					</p>
						<h4 class="editable">Transport from Santa Lucia Railway Station</h4>
						<p>
							In front of the railway station you find the services for 
							<a href="https://actv.avmspa.it/it" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">water transports and the tickets</a> stand. 
							Many hotels can also easily be reached on foot. Some sightseeing on the way: the Grand Canal opens up in front of 
							you as you exit the Station. Before descending the first step of the stone stairs, above your head a  Murano glass 
							aquarium reminds you of the richness of marine life. In 2018, before Covid, while getting the train to go to Zurich 
							at ETH, Alma noticed that hundreds of fishes swam above her head in the Venice Station. In Alma the kaleidoscope of 
							sea creatures in the transparency of glass reawakened the love for the sea, the joy of swimming, the passion for fishing.
						</p>
					<h3 class="editable">Arriving by plane</h3>
						<h4 class="editable">Transport from Marco Polo airport</h4>
							<h5 class="editable">Water (direct) and road Taxis (via Piazzale Roma)</h5>
							<p>
								You can take a private water taxi directly to your final destination (which is an expensive choice, from the airport to 
								Palazzo Franchetti it costs about €100.00). Alternatively, you can take a road taxi to Piazzale Roma, and then follow 
								directions from Piazzale Roma (40 Euros).
							</p>
							<h5 class="editable">Alilaguna waterbus service (via city center)</h5>
							<p>
								This company offers a service that goes from the airport to Murano, the Lido, the Arsenale with a final stop at San Marco. 
								Tickets cost €15.00 and can be purchased in the arrival hall of the airport, directly on board, or online (€15.00). The 
								service runs from 6 am until midnight. For timetables and further information visit

								direction Accademia.
							</p>
							<h5 class="editable">ATVO buses (via Piazzale Roma)</h5>
							<p>
								These blue shuttle buses run from the airport to Piazzale Roma, leaving from the entrance of the departure hall. Tickets cost 
								€10 one way, €18 return. Automatic ticket machines can be found in the baggage hall, in the arrivals hall, and outside the airport. 
								The service runs from 4.20 am to 1.20 am and takes about 20 minutes to reach Venice. For timetables and further information visit ATVO.

					<h3 class="editable">Arriving by car</h3>
					<p>
						If you drive to Venice, you will have to pay for a garage or parking space during your stay. The last points in Venice where 
						you can leave your car are "Piazzale Roma" and "Tronchetto". Parking at "Piazzale Roma" in the Municipal Garage costs €24.00-29.00 
						for 24 hours, in the private Garage San Marco (next door) it costs €30.00 for 24 hours. To reach the Tronchetto parking area, as 
						you come into Venice, follow the signs and turn right before "Piazzale Roma". Parking here costs €21.00 for 24 hours. (Do not leave 
						valuables in the car. There is a luggage deposit office, open daily 8 a.m. - 8 p.m., next to the Pullman Bar on the ground floor of 
						the Municipal Garage at "Piazzale Roma"). You can reach Piazzale Roma from Tronchetto through the People Mover. Another solution is 
						to park your car in front of the train station in Mestre. Parking in Mestre costs much less (around € 5.00 - € 9.00 per day), and 
						there are frequent trains and buses between Mestre and Venice Piazzale Roma. Then follow the directions from Piazzale Roma or from 
						the train station to Accademia.
