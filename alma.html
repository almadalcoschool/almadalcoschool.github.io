                <p>
                    Despite her young age, made important and valuable discoveries at the frontier between physics and microbiology 
                    by revealing how metabolic interactions at very small spatial scales structure microbial communities. 
                    Her interests are better explained by her own words: "I was doing physics when biology ran over me. 
                    I got fascinated by how complex functionality arises in ... bacterial communities... . If I am not in the office, 
                    I am at the piano. If I am not at the piano, I am underwater spearfishing." The Alma Dal Co School aims to inspire 
                    early career researchers to pursue groundbreaking research in the spirit of Alma Dal Co's passion for knowledge, 
                    innovation and multidisciplinary research. <br>
