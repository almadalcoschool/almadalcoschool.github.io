				<p class="editable">Alma Dal Co (1989- 2022) grew up in Venice, and as a child, she enjoyed the freedom and independence 
					that the City offers to kids. Despite her young age, made important and valuable discoveries at the frontier between
					 physics and microbiology by revealing how metabolic interactions at very small spatial scales structure microbial communities. 
					 Her interests are better explained by her own words:  "I was doing physics when biology ran over me. I got fascinated by 
					 how complex functionality arises in ... bacterial communities... . If I am not in the office, I am at the piano. 
					 If I am not at the piano, I am underwater spearfishing."1 The Alma Dal Co School aims to inspire early career researchers 
					 to pursue groundbreaking research in the spirit of Alma Dal Co's passion for knowledge, innovation and multidisciplinary research.
