                <h2 class="editable"> Overview </h2>
                <p>
                    Collective behaviour occurs at every scale of spatiotemporal organization of living matter: 
                    molecules within cells, microbes, cells within multicellular organisms, and societies all 
                    display organized behaviours that transcend the properties of one single element in isolation. 
                    Collective, macroscopic modes emerge as the result of interactions among the composing units, 
                    often encompassing and integrating lower-level heterogeneity. Changes in collective behaviour 
                    can be characterized on short time scales, those associated with its establishment and functioning, 
                    but also on longer, evolutionary time scales, where their functions get shaped by selection.
                    Studying collective behaviour involves methods of observation and modelling that span across 
                    disciplines: biochemistry, molecular biology, physics, informatics, ecology and evolution. 
                    The school will cover several of those approaches and encourage cross-talk between all 
                    participants, exploiting the diversity of backgrounds, career stages, and expertise.

                <h2>School Description & Objectives</h2>
                <p>
                    The School on Collective Behaviour perpetuates <a href="https://almadalcoschool.github.io/alma/" class="editable">Alma Dal Co School</a> 
                    's open, bold and generous approach to science, 
                    pursuing a twofold objective. First, young scientists will be exposed to exciting research on a particular 
                    topic, through different points of view and interdisciplinary expertise. Second, senior participants will 
                    have the opportunity to meet talented students and to hear about complementary approaches to their own research.
                    The School is organized in a highly interactive format, to foster communication across disciplines and career 
                    stages. Development of a shared language, and a common understanding of different approaches will be supported
                    by introductory lectures given by world experts in collective behaviour research. Ample time will be allocated
                    to discussion and exchange of ideas among participants.

                <h2 class="editable">Topics</h2>
                <p>
                    The first Alma Dal Co School will cover a variety of biological systems displaying collective behaviour, from 
                    cellular movement and microbial coordination, to the self-organization of tissues and aggregates, the ecological 
                    and evolutionary dynamics of social insects, and the behaviour of human societies.<br>

                    It is organized in six different modules, spanning different spatial and temporal scales of organization.<br>
                    
                    At the smallest spatial scale, collective behaviour manifests itself in the coordinated movement of single cells 
                    within supra-cellular structures, such as aggregates, swarms, or biofilms. Similarly, cell coordination is central 
                    when cells are embedded in a multicellular environment, for instance in tissue rearrangement or during development. 
                    At a supra-organismal scale, animal societies display a range of collective behaviours. Recent years have witnessed 
                    a drastic increase in the resolution of individual behaviours within animal societies or groups. Inclusion of 
                    heterogeneity within collectives, both in terms of individual behaviour and of interaction networks, is key to 
                    understanding the emergence of functionality at the level of groups or populations, such as for collective 
                    decision-making or collective intelligence.<br>
                    
                    Beside manifesting itself at different organizational scales, collective behaviour involves different time scales. 
                    On short time scales, researchers are interested in understanding the mechanisms that underpin the exchange of 
                    information and the spatial arrangement of individuals.<br> 
                    
                    On a longer timescale, understanding how collective behaviours emerged during the history of life and what 
                    selective pressures shape them requires to consider —and sometimes mimic— evolutionary processes.

                    A social event will introduce the participants to the Venice Biennale, the world famous international cultural 
                    exhibition. The title of the Biennale Architettura 2025 is <i>'Intelligens. Natural. Artificial. Collective.'</i>  offering 
                    a close connection with the themes of the school.<br>
                    
                    A <b>Lecture</b> by Andrea Rinaldo, Prof. of Maritime hydraulic construction and hydrology (Padua University), will introduce 
                    the participants to Venice and its Lagoon, both World Heritage sites. The lecture will illustrate the impact of 
                    the high tide on the city and the Lagoon and the protection system (MOSE), as another example of collective behaviour.<br>
                    
                    Finally, <b>Conversation on Science and Music</b> will take place at the conclusion of the School, giving insights in 
                    cognitive, neuro-sciences and contemporary philosophy, to connect the two branches of interest of the Alma dal Co 
                    Foundation: science and music.

                    Despite her young age, made important and valuable discoveries at the frontier between physics and microbiology 
                    by revealing how metabolic interactions at very small spatial scales structure microbial communities. 
                    Her interests are better explained by her own words: "I was doing physics when biology ran over me. 
                    I got fascinated by how complex functionality arises in ... bacterial communities... . If I am not in the office, 
                    I am at the piano. If I am not at the piano, I am underwater spearfishing." The Alma Dal Co School aims to inspire 
                    early career researchers to pursue groundbreaking research in the spirit of Alma Dal Co's passion for knowledge, 
                    innovation and multidisciplinary research.
