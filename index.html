                    <h3 class="editable"> An interdisciplinary meeting on collective behaviour across biological systems. </h3>    
                    <p>
                        Collective behaviour occurs at every scale of spatiotemporal organization of living matter: 
                        molecules within cells, microbes, cells within multicellular organisms, and societies all 
                        display organized behaviours that transcend the properties of one single element in isolation. 
                        Collective, macroscopic modes emerge as the result of interactions among the composing units, 
                        often encompassing and integrating lower-level heterogeneity. Changes in collective behaviour 
                        can be characterized on short time scales, those associated with its establishment and functioning, 
                        but also on longer, evolutionary time scales, where their functions get shaped by selection.
                        Studying collective behaviour involves methods of observation and modelling that span across 
                        disciplines: biochemistry, molecular biology, physics, informatics, ecology and evolution. 
                        The school will cover several of those approaches and encourage cross-talk between all 
                        participants, exploiting the diversity of backgrounds, career stages, and expertise.

                <p>
                    The first Alma Dal Co School will cover a variety of biological systems displaying collective behaviour, from 
                    cellular movement and microbial coordination, to the self-organization of tissues and aggregates, the ecological 
                    and evolutionary dynamics of social insects, and the behaviour of human societies.<br>

                    It is organized in six different modules, spanning different spatial and temporal scales of organization.<br>
                    
                    At the smallest spatial scale, collective behaviour manifests itself in the coordinated movement of single cells 
                    within supra-cellular structures, such as aggregates, swarms, or biofilms. Similarly, cell coordination is central 
                    when cells are embedded in a multicellular environment, for instance in tissue rearrangement or during development. 
                    At a supra-organismal scale, animal societies display a range of collective behaviours. Recent years have witnessed 
                    a drastic increase in the resolution of individual behaviours within animal societies or groups. Inclusion of 
                    heterogeneity within collectives, both in terms of individual behaviour and of interaction networks, is key to 
                    understanding the emergence of functionality at the level of groups or populations, such as for collective 
                    decision-making or collective intelligence.<br>
                    
                    Beside manifesting itself at different organizational scales, collective behaviour involves different time scales. 
                    On short time scales, researchers are interested in understanding the mechanisms that underpin the exchange of 
                    information and the spatial arrangement of individuals.<br> 
                    
                    On a longer timescale, understanding how collective behaviours emerged during the history of life and what 
                    selective pressures shape them requires to consider —and sometimes mimic— evolutionary processes.

                <h2>School Objectives & Ethos</h2>
                <p>
                    The School on Collective Behaviour perpetuates <a href="https://almadalcoschool.github.io/alma/" class="editable">Alma Dal Co School</a> 
                    's open, bold and generous approach to science, 
                    pursuing a twofold objective. First, young scientists will be exposed to exciting research on a particular 
                    topic, through different points of view and interdisciplinary expertise. Second, senior participants will 
                    have the opportunity to meet talented students and to hear about complementary approaches to their own research.
                    The School is organized in a highly interactive format, to foster communication across disciplines and career 
                    stages. Development of a shared language, and a common understanding of different approaches will be supported
                    by introductory lectures given by world experts in collective behaviour research. Ample time will be allocated
                    to discussion and exchange of ideas among participants.
